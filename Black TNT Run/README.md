This map is a type of minigame where you have to run and jump across a field of mines. The mines are in fact pressure plates which trigger a TNT block if stepped on. Each level looks a little bit different and we recommend that you carefully plan your route before starting as you can never stop and think during a level
# How to play?
In each level the objective is to get safely over to the other side by jumping on the pressure plates. Don’t stay too long on one spot as then you will fall down to certain death.

After completing a level you should take the gold ingot and bring it to the “ender chest” to access the next level. It is not real ender chests! This works for 0.16!
