This map includes 8 different memory challenges. Each level has a couple of separate rooms. In the first one you have to try to memorize all of the blocks and in the second one you have to try to spot a difference. This is a great challenge for anyone who enjoy puzzles or similar games where you need to focus your mind. The first few levels shouldn’t be much of a hassle but just wait until you get to later levels!
# How to play?
- Enter the first room and then try to memorize all of the blocks and where they are placed in the room.
- Whenever you are ready step into the next room. It will look much similar to the first room but there will be one difference and it’s your job to try to spot it. (Buttons and doors don’t count as differences!)
- Next, step into the third room and select the block which was different. If you were correct then a door will open which you can enter through to move onto the next level.

But if you were wrong then the room will explode.
